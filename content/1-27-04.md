# Building a blog
### The simple way

I knew I wanted a solution that would allow me to update content effortlessly without the need for a complex admin backend. My primary objective was to establish a simple online presence without the overhead of managing intricate systems.

With this goal in mind, I began exploring various options available to me. Initially, I considered using Node.js. However, upon closer examination, I found that Node.js, while powerful, was too bloated for my requirements. The sheer complexity of setting up and maintaining a Node.js environment seemed excessive for what I needed.

PHP emerged as another potential option. However, my experience with PHP dated back over 15 years, and the thought of navigating its learning curve again didn't appeal to me. I sought a solution that would be intuitive and straightforward, without requiring me to relearn a language and ecosystem I had long set aside.

Having previously worked with Flask for other projects, I found its lightweight nature and Pythonic approach appealing. Flask provided the simplicity and flexibility I desired, coupled with a familiar programming language in Python. Furthermore, Flask comes bundled with Jinja templating, offering a seamless integration for rendering dynamic content.

After careful consideration, I settled on a simple Flask server as the foundation for my blog. With the Markdown2 library, I discovered a straightforward method to convert Markdown files into HTML, enabling me to publish content with ease. The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity â€“ all I need to do is add a new .md file, and my blog updates automatically.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
import markdown2
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Get the directory containing the markdown files
    content_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'content')
    markdown_files = os.listdir(content_dir)

    # Load and convert content from all Markdown files
    html_content = ""
    for file in markdown_files:
        if file.endswith('.md'):  # Corrected file extension check
            md_file_path = os.path.join(content_dir, file)
            with open(md_file_path, 'r') as md_file:
                content = md_file.read()

            # Convert Markdown to HTML using markdown2 with extras
            html = markdown2.markdown(content, extras=["fenced-code-blocks"])
            html_content += html + "\n"

    return render_template('index.html', content=html_content)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Bind the app to 0.0.0.0 and the specified port for Render
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 10000)))

```

With this markdown2 will take my markdown files, render those as html. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
    <title>My Blog</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        {{ content|safe }}
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
