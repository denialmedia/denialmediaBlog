I knew I wanted something I could  update the content in a simple way, I didn't feel the need to make an admin backend and all that for what I needed. Just a simple online prescense. 

With that in mind, I started looking into what some of my options where.  I looked at node, but just in itself is to bloated for what I was wanting or needing. PHP? Could be an option, but not something I have looked at in 15 years. So the learning curve, not something I want to deal with. 

I have used *Flask* in the past for some other projects. I enjoyed it, and it's light weight enough. I'm comfartable with python. So, that is settled. So I already have access to Jinja templating, it comes with Flask. 

So I decided a simple Flask server, with Markdown2 library I could make a nice simple blog that all I need to do is add a new .md file and it will update.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
import markdown2
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Get the directory containing the markdown files
    content_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'content')
    markdown_files = os.listdir(content_dir)

    # Load and convert content from all Markdown files
    html_content = ""
    for file in markdown_files:
        if file.endswith('.md'):  # Corrected file extension check
            md_file_path = os.path.join(content_dir, file)
            with open(md_file_path, 'r') as md_file:
                content = md_file.read()

            # Convert Markdown to HTML using markdown2 with extras
            html = markdown2.markdown(content, extras=["fenced-code-blocks"])
            html_content += html + "\n"

    return render_template('index.html', content=html_content)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Bind the app to 0.0.0.0 and the specified port for Render
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 10000)))

```

With this markdown2 will take my markdown files, render those as html. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
    <title>My Blog</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        {{ content|safe }}
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
